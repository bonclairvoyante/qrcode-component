## Overview

## My process

I first generated boilerplate html using Emmet. Then I wrote the HTML and assigned classes to elements I wanted to modify in CSS. Then I wrote the CSS but saw no need for media queries as it is worked well on all viewports.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned the power of using Flexbox.

### Continued development

I completed this challenge after learning html and css. I will continue to implement what I have learned. I realised that I need more practice to use Flexbox comfortably.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me for HTML and CSS. I really liked using documentation as I code and will use it going forward.
- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is an amazing article/turtorial/documentation that visualizes how the Flexbox layout works.
